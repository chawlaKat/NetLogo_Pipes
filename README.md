# NetLogo Pipes
A getting-to-know-you project with NetLogo. Using NetLogo's mutli-agent modelling software, this program allows the user to generate several agents that move around the field, simulating the "Pipes" screensaver.

To run: open the .nlogo file using NetLogo's desktop client. If desired, adjust the number of agents, then click "setup" and "go".
